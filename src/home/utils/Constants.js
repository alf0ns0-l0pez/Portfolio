        If you have ever worked with Data Acquisition Card(DAQ) or Actuators Card you realized that the most of them it is 
        necessary to be in front of them to known the state such as sensors and process status instead take a look in its webpage 
        and known it anytime and anywhere into its intranet, all this is reduced in wasted time.<br/>

    "details":<p>This project exists since 2020, turn the MINER RIG COMPUTER on and off remotely and automatically while was connected 
        to edge computer which worked as a server allowing the use of power electronics in a safe and isolated way, 
        it could turn the MINER RIG COMPUTER on after a power outage adding a time delay 15 minutes, This could be a task for a UPS but the 
        current of a MINING RIG exceeds 5 Amps, so for that reason this card was an economical solution and supported up to 8 MINING RIGS<br/>
