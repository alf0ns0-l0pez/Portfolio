                <p>“I often compare open source to science. Science took
                    this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and
                    improving on other peoples' ideas. It made science what
                    it is today and made the incredible advances that we have
                    had possible. And I compare that to witchcraft and alchemy,
                    where openness was something you didn't do”.<br /><br /><span>-Linus Torvalds-</span></p>
